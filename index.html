<p>I spent the majority of this last year organizing <a href="http://hackrpi.com">HackRPI</a> because hackathons are amazing and every school with a computer science program should host one.</p>

<p>HackRPI went very well, but in the process of raising sponsorship, working on our design and branding, and managing our budget, I had stopped programming entirely. Since then I've started slowly working on my side projects again, but I felt like some external motivation would help me dive right back in to it.</p>

<p>Follow me on this journey with the hashtag #100daysofhacking. I'll be keeping an eye out for cool updates with that hashtag and put them up on the site.</p>

<p>If for any reason you don't want an update to be posted, email me (email address on my GitHub profile) and I'll take it down.</p>
