100 Days of Hacking
===================

I spent the majority of this last year organizing
[HackRPI](http://www.hackrpi.com/) because hackathons are amazing and every
school with a computer science program should host one.

HackRPI went very well, but in the process of raising sponsorship, working on
our design and branding, and managing our budget, I had stopped programming
entirely. Since then I've started slowly working on my side projects again,
but I felt like some external motivation would help me dive right back in to
it.

Follow me on this journey with the hashtag #100daysofhacking. I'll be keeping
an eye out for cool updates with that hashtag and put them up on the site.

If for any reason you don't want an update to be posted, email me (email
address on my GitHub profile) and I'll take it down.
