Today I worked on getting this very website up and running. I purchased the
domain name a few weeks ago when I first thought up the idea of this personal
challenge. There's still a lot I want to do with the site, but true to the
spirit of what I'm trying to accomplish here, I'm going to say it's good
enough to ship.

The features that I'd like to implement in the near future:

 - Commenting (probably with [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/))
 - Twitter/Facebook/Instagram feeds of #100daysofhacking
 - A way to query days based on which project I'm working on (with tags)
 
Since the site will definitely look very different by the end of these 100
days than it does now, here's a screenshot of the way it looks at the time
of this writing.

For those who are curious about how the site is implemented:

 - It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
 [GitHub](https://github.com/Robmaister/100daysofhacking) for free.
 - The domain was purchased from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and
 I'm using [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/) to manage DNS.
 - I'm using the [Clean Blog](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/clean-blog/)
 theme for Jekyll, modified slightly to include photo credits.
 
So far all of the images on the site are ones I've shot myself. Earlier today
I made a sweep through all the photos I've ever taken on my Canon Rebel XT and
picked out all the nice ones I thought would look good as backgrounds and ran
them through [Optimizilla](http://optimizilla.com/).

So here's to the next 100 days, I hope you'll join me on this journey!
