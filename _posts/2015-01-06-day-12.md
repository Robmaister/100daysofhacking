This morning a user I was following up with on [a GitHub issue][1] tried the
new 1.0.0-alpha.1 build and gave some feedback. What I found the most
interesting was a polygonization case that was failing. I'd imagine that a
region like this would be split up into 3, but since it's not actually
connecting to any region besides the one, it makes sense. Here's the region
in the user's level:

If it's not clear, the region in question is the yellow-green one circling
around a building at connecting itself twice to the lavender (?) region at the
bottom of the image.

Here's how it gets polygonized right now in `PolyMesh`:

Also notice how the region inside the building in the middle isn't getting
polygonized properly. I plan on fixing this later tonight as well as making
the other changes I said I would make.

Outside of SharpNav I also helped my friend out with some work at his dad's
company again. Today we bonded fiberglass to the wing with epoxy. We made far
too much of it and overestimated on the hardener, so we had a large (and very
hot) cup of leftover epoxy, as seen in the header image.

I also looked over some digital image stabilization code. OpenCV + CUDA has
some strangely large binaries. It's the first time I've ever seen a 300MB+
DLL.

There isn't much else I've got for today, my sleep schedule is pretty unusal
right now :P
