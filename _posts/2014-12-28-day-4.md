So today I continued work on fixing the `PolyMeshDetail` bug in SharpNav. By
updating my process to match Recast's, I got some polygons to properly add
detail and generate a Delaunay hull, but it now seems that some of the other
polygons are not generating properly.

Recast's update added a `TriangulateHull` method that would simply triangulate
a convex polygon in the case that the polygon was small or thin. Since the
detail step is doing very little in the example map outside of the two hilly
areas off to the side, this fixed one of the four triangles that were being
triangulated badly.

As you can see on the bottom left, the addition of a single internal point to
a mesh now works just fine, but the one polygon with two internal points has a
nice big hole inside of it.

It now appears that adding 0 or 1 internal points to a polygon works fine, but
when a polygon is sufficiently large enough or over a detailed enough part of
the map and 2 or more internal points need to be added, it doesn't triangulate
properly and might actually stop early with one internal point.

So now that some, but not all of the polygons that were producing errors were
fixed, I can scope down the issue to an error in either `DelaunayHull` or the
second half of `BuildPolyDetail` and only for polygons that require two or
more additional internal points.

Now that I've scoped it down more, I think I may be able to fix it entirely
tomorrow.
