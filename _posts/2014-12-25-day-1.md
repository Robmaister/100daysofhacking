So my first real day of #100daysofhacking ended with a [commit to SharpNav](https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpNav/commit/e66395e10192411ee2f8696b3f745cd78d409d8c)
past midnight, meaning I actually have no commits to show for my first day.

I can explain.

I had actually finished the bit that I wanted to get done today just before
midnight. When I went to test the code and make sure there were no
regressions, I noticed a pretty big issue that I had to debug so as to prevent
breaking the build.

Before I go any further, SharpNav is a port of the amazing [Recast Navigation](https://github.com/memononen/recastnavigation) to C#. Recast is a library
that generates navigation meshes from your level's geometry. There's one
[excellent resource](http://critterai.org/projects/nmgen_study/overview.html)
that explains the whole process, but for those who don't have the time to go
over all of it in detail, here's the *tl;dr*:

 - Voxelizes level geometry into a `Heightfield`.
 - Stores the open space around the level as a `CompactHeightfield`
 - Splits walkable parts of the level up into flood-filled regions.
 - Traces over region edges to form `Contour`s that are stored in a
 `ContourSet`.
 - Subdivides `Contour`s into convex polygons that are stored in a `PolyMesh`.
 - Adds detail from the `CompactHeightfield` to make a `PolyMeshDetail`.

After that, you can use the resulting meshes to find paths through your level.
SharpNav, like Recast, also aims to provide pathfinding and crowd management,
but for the moment I'm focusing on getting the navigation mesh generation
working and well-designed.
 
My original change was to move the creation of a `ContourSet` from it's
constructor to an instance method in `CompactHeightfield`. That means:

{% highlight csharp %}
var contours = new ContourSet(compactHeightfield, settings);
{% endhighlight %}

is now:

{% highlight csharp %}
var contours = compactHeightfield.BuildContourSet(settings);
{% endhighlight %}

I made this change for a few reasons:

 1. The `ContourSet` constructor was iterating over the `CompactHeightfield` a
 lot. By lines, it was about half the file.
 2. A `ContourSet` data strucutre should stand alone. It should allow you to
 add, remove, and apply set operations to your `Contour`s. Building the
 contours shouldn't be a part of it's job.
 3. By reducing how deeply coupled all of these main classes are, I can better
 encapsulate them all instead of leaving some members with the `internal`
 access modifier.
 4. If the JIT on a user's machine isn't that smart, there would be a lot of
 overhead introduced by accessing arrays through properties in a reference to
 an instance of another class.
 5. In general I believe I 'push' pipeline is better than a 'pull' pipeline.
 Classes should be pushing their data out into the next step's format, not
 the other way around.
 
Anyways, a little copy/pasting and refactoring later, and the change was made.
When I went to go test the code, I noticed the massive offset that you can see
in the header image of this post.

I figured I had stumbled upon some bug in `PolyMesh` due to an offset/border
changing. I stepped through the debugger and followed the first polygon by
hand until I realized that wasn't the issue.

![Debugging](/img/post/day1/debug.jpg)

It turns out I had just forgotten to pass the bounding box of the
level along, but in the process of debugging I had discovered two things:

 1. I had some weird offsets when drawing a `PolyMesh` that I corrected
 2. Running through my code side-by-side with Recast to make sure I was doing
 all the math fine, I found that I was at some point calculating (a ^ b) while
 Recast was doing (!a ^ !b). I now realize that the two logic statements are
 equivalent, but while debugging I wasn't thinking about it.
 
So now I have my original change plus one extra bugfix that took about an hour
and a half to complete. Seems like a pretty good day to me. Onward!
