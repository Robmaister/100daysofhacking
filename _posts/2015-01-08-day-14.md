I ended up choosing SharpDoc to build SharpNav's documentation. The choice
was pretty much arbitrary. I figured I'd probably have to make some
modifications to either one. So I dove right into SharpDoc's source, figured
out how to build a proper [config.xml][1] and also the proper command-line
options to build it.

It's live right now at [sharpnav.com/docs][2]!

I ran into a few issues while working with it, all of which I submitted back
to xoofx's repository as pull requests.

  - There isn't a NuGet package, so I opened [a GitHub issue][3] asking if the
  original author would maintain one.
  - I'm writing release notes for each new version of SharpNav that gets
  released. I named these files as their versions (`v0.9.2.md` for example),
  but the permanent links that were being generated were incorrect. It was
  looking for `v0.htm` instead of `v0.9.2.htm`.
    - [Pull Request #20][4]
  - Every single page for a class or method would bring up a javascript alert
  box saying the F# brush file was missing. There was a recent-ish pull
  request that added support for F#, but seemingly forgot to add the file that
  it referenced in the diff. So I found it online under a permissive (WTFPL)
  license and added it in.
    - [Pull Request #22][5]
	
I've still got quite a bit of work to do on the docs, but mostly creating my
own style for it that incorporates the SharpNav logo and everything. I'd also
like to see URLs being updated when pages are clicked on as well as smoothly
loading new pages. Both of those are changes I'd contribute back to SharpDoc.

I've also been thinking that on top of SharpNav's usefulness as a library for
pathfinding and navmesh generation, it could also be very useful as an example
of how to maintain a project. Or at least it could once I get all my ducks in
a row with documentation and moving things around.

  - I follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
  - I have unit tests (though they are seriously lacking)
  - I've got a website for the project published through GitHub Pages
  - I have the beginnings of a Wiki
  - I have CI (continuous integration) running for every commit on Linux via
  Travis CI and (shortly) on Windows via AppVeyor.
  - All of my source code is properly licensed
  - Major contributors are credited in the copyright
  - It's got an up-to-date package on NuGet
  - Most of the code is documented
  
Given how much time I've sunk into reading about all of this, especially the
minutae like proper methods of package restore on NuGet, I think it's a great
project to model after in terms of project structure. It's far from ideal, but
it's better than a lot of other repos I've seen out there.

This might also be the foundation of a cool [RCOS][6] talk about maintaining
projects and basically all the other useful things that you should be doing
with your repository that isn't writing code.
