Ok, so I slipped up a bit. I went to bed at 8pm without writing this post. I
have a good reason for this though. I was up pretty late two nights ago as
usual, working on SharpNav, but I also had to be up at 8am to do some pretty
cool stuff yesterday with a friend for his dad's company. I'll get into that
later though.

###SharpNav

First, I'm going to talk about the changes I made to SharpNav yesterday (2
nights ago?). The first thing I did was some more refactoring to include the
NavPoint struct in more places and add some more documentation. The same stuff
I said I'd do on my last post, which is relatively dry stuff.

The more interesting thing I did with SharpNav was silence a bunch of
[StyleCop][1] and then realize that the small change I made was actually a
good design choice that I should have made at the very beginning.

Every file in SharpNav that uses a `Vector3` has a pretty sizeable block of
preprocessor statements at the top that determines which library's version of
Vector3 it should use:

{% highlight csharp %}
#if MONOGAME
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
#elif OPENTK
using OpenTK;
#elif SHARPDX
using SharpDX;
#endif
{% endhighlight %}

The theoretical problem with this is that I'm importing the whole namespace.
This is bad because it can cause name collisions if I name a class in SharpNav
the same thing as one from OpenTK. In practice this would have only been an
issue in case of [MathHelper][2] and looking back at it now, I'm not entirely
sure how this wasn't causing an issue. Maybe I wasn't using `MathHelper` and
`Vector3` in the same file, or maybe there were no conflicting method names
between the two classes.

Anyways, the change I made was turning the usings into aliases, like so:

{% highlight csharp %}
#if MONOGAME
using Vector3 = Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector3;
#elif OPENTK
using Vector3 = OpenTK.Vector3;
#elif SHARPDX
using Vector3 = SharpDX.Vector3;
#endif
{% endhighlight %}

This solves the theorectical problem as it only imports a single class from a
namespace and also shaves off 80 or so StyleCop warnings.

Between this change, the changing of the header comment format, and some
refactoring, **I reduced 309 compiler warnings down to 183**, which are now
almost entirely warnings about missing documentation comments.

###The Other Stuff

Yesterday morning I woke up and met my friend at his dad's office. I had done
an internship/freelance work for them in high school, and I'm back home for
winter break without much to do for the next 2 weeks, so I figured I might as
well see if they had any work that needed doing.

They did.

But I didn't end up writing code for them yesterday, instead I'm helping them
iterate a design for a wing of a surveillance drone. I wouldn't be able to
name any of the materials we used, but I had a great time yesterday and I like
diving right into something I know nothing about. It's fun. There's so much to
learn!

I doubt I'd be able to disclose any details, but the code I'll be working on
today and in the next two weeks are related to image stabilization. More to
come!
