Continuing on yesterday's format, I'll start by writing a bit about what I did
yesterday.

I started refactoring the pathfinding code in SharpNav. I noticed that a lot
of methods returned bools and had two `out` parameters at the end, an integer
and a `Vector3`. They were almost always passed to functions together and were
used to describe a point on the NavMesh. So I went ahead and made a struct for
them called `NavPoint`. This simplified the methods that I changed to use it.

The other major change I started making in the pathfinding code was removing
the `bool` return values. These methods are now wrapped in a class that can
guarantee correct state for most of the things that the `bool` return value
checks, like whether or not it has a navmesh at all.

In retrospect, that structure more closely resembles how CritterAI, a C# and
Java wrapper of Recast, does it. I will start looking at CritterAI more as a
reference for these changes.

The other major change I made was converting the license notice at the top of
every file to a new format. On both Mono and .NET, the C# compiler sees a
block comment like this:

{% highlight csharp %}
/**
 * Merges two instances of Foo together.
 */
{% endhighlight %}

as a [documentation comment][1] instead of a regular comment. Because of that,
it complains that the first line below it (usually `using System;`) is not a
valid target for a doc comment. This floods the compilation output with a ton
of errors. The solution is to use a regular comment instead.

In SharpFont, I include the entirety of the MIT license at the top of each
file, but when I started SharpNav, I didn't want that much bloat so I wrote a
two-liner that points to the LICENSE file in the repository. Because of this,
I now have a 6 line header with 2 lines of actual content. So I also decided
to shave off the surrounding `#region` since it wasn't a 20-line file header.

The old header:

{% highlight csharp %}
#region License
/**
 * Copyright (c) 2013-2015 Robert Rouhani <robert.rouhani@gmail.com> and other contributors (see CONTRIBUTORS file).
 * Licensed under the MIT License - https://raw.github.com/Robmaister/SharpNav/master/LICENSE
 */
#endregion
{% endhighlight %}

and the new one:

{% highlight csharp %}
// Copyright (c) 2013-2015 Robert Rouhani <robert.rouhani@gmail.com> and other contributors (see CONTRIBUTORS file).
// Licensed under the MIT License - https://raw.github.com/Robmaister/SharpNav/master/LICENSE
{% endhighlight %}

This change saved me around 70 compiler warnings (now down to 312, mostly for
missing or outdated documentation).

Since the copyright years matter, I couldn't just take the same license and
copy-paste it everywhere. I had to write a script to make the change for me,
so I did just that.

I wrote a small bash script to recursively iterate all .cs files in the
current directory outside of `bin/` and `obj/` directories, and run a short
`awk` one-liner to make the change to each file. I haven't really had any
experience with `awk` or `sed`, so I had a fun time learning about how it
works. There's probably a more optimal way to do this, but hey, it works!

{% highlight awk %}
{
	if (NR == 0 && $0 != "#region License")
		exit 0;
	if (NR > 5)
		print $0;
	else if (NR == 2 || NR == 3)
		print sprintf("//%s", substr($0, 3))
}
{% endhighlight %}

(Above code snippet was spaced out but the original script was a one-liner)

Between yesterday and this morning, that's what I accomplished.

----------

What I plan on doing for the rest of today is continuing adding `NavPoint` to
method definitions and also reducing the number of compiler warnings by
writing and updating documentation.

![Mismatching documentation and code](/img/post/day10/mismatched.png)

When I refer to "updating" documentation, it's usually an avoidable mistake
that I make. Visual Studio has the ability to reorder paramters and refactor
all references to it. When I'm writing code, I'll forget that this feature
exists and move the parameters around and update the references by hand. C#'s
doc comments want documentation for each paramter, an they want those
parameters to all be in order. When I manually move parameters around, the doc
comments no longer match the method definition and the compiler spits out a
warning because I have configured it to do so.

I'm also going to continue using StyleCop to ensure the entire code base is
styled and structured uniformly. I'd also like to start using FxCop to make
sure I'm not doing anything stupid with the public API before I lock into a
final API with 1.0.0.
