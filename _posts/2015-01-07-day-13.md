Last night I made a few minor changes (though I have not committed them since
I got sidetracked) based on feedback I got from a GitHub issue. I got
sidetracked trying to figure out the best way to generate online documentation
for SharpNav as I figured this would be useful to users and could be
automatically updated on the `gh-pages` branch every time I push thanks to the
continuous integration I have set up.

So I began looking. I knew that Sandcastle was the system that Microsoft was
supporting a while back. There are also a handful of other systems for this
like Doxygen, NDoc, and a bunch of paid ones that are not suitable for a free
and open source project like SharpNav. Most of them were abandoned years ago.

What I ended up trying was [SHFB - Sandcastle Help File Builder][1]. The
original Sandcastle site says the project is no longer officially supported
and that SHFB was now the maintainer. So I gave it a shot. It came as an
installer, which wasn't ideal for my purposes, but on the flipside it
integrated well with Visual Studio/MSBuild. This would definitely be helpful
as I might be able to build it as a target from xbuild on Travis CI.

I never got to testing that part, as I had too many gripes with it earlier on:

![MAML](/img/post/day13/shfb.png)

  - You have to build pages with [MAML][2], an XML-based markup language that
    focuses on content rather than style. While this is a logical abstraction,
    I feel it's absolutely unnecessary. I much prefer something lightwieght
    like markdown.
  - The documentation is surprisingly lacking in certain areas. There were a
    few forum posts implying that there's a client-side search function for
    web documentation, yet it all appears to be implemented in ASP.NET which I
    can't host on GitHub Pages.
  - It takes an order of magnitude longer to build documentation than it does
    to compile all of SharpNav. Sandcastle feels **very** bulky.
  - There's a NuGet package for SHFB, but it's entirely undocumented. I have
    no idea whether or not it can be run on Linux or if the package is enough
    to build HTML documentation.
	
**So I'm going to scrap SHFB** before I ever commit anything about it to the
repo. The alternatives I'm looking at are [SharpDoc][3] and [SharpDox][4].

SharpDoc was spawned from SharpDX's need for lightweight documentation
generation. It's still pretty bleeding edge, there's no NuGet package for it,
and no unit tests/continuous integration of it's own. Two examples of it being
used - the [SharpDX documentation][5] and the [SharpRazor documentation][6].

I'm not entirely sure of SharpDox's history, but the one example I can find of
it being used is the [example on their website][7]

Both solutions are about equally active, with their most recent commits being
around last September/October (3-ish months ago). There is a
[NuGet package][8], but it's for creating plugins for SharpDox, so I doubt it
would actually be able to compile anything.

Tomorrow I plan on really diving into code again after I figure out which tool
I'm going to use and working through implementing it and going through all the
branding and design that it should be going through to look good.
