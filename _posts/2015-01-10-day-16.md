As promised, here's my second post today, right before I go to bed. Earlier
on, I had come up with a system that I wanted to set up for SharpNav to build
navigation meshes on the command line with config files (as well as actual
serialization of navigation meshes). Today I started work on that. 

But first, I also made a pretty important change to the structure of SharpNav.
All of the source code is now shoved in a `Source/` directory in order to
avoid cluttering the root directory too much. Since I have a lot of references
in to the projects from build scripts and out from them to resources (and the
output directory), there were a **LOT** of relative directories that needed
fixing. I had `..\` in my clipboard for most of the process, and `Source/` in
the remaining time.

After all of this, I tried to open up the solution in Visual Studio and build
it. 

**1 build error**

...

There was a reference sitting in a `.resx` file that I hadn't noticed.

I later found out that I was also missing one instance of `Source/` in my
Travis CI config, which I fixed promptly.

---------------

So now back to my plan for building on the command line.

My plan was to have a configuration file that references source geometry
files, transforms them, and settings for the NavMesh generation process (that
would be read to a `NavMeshGenerationSettings` class). A bunch of these
configuration files could be queued up or piped in to one utility that would
take each configuration file and output a navmesh.

The configuration file would be written in YAML and have an `.sncfg` extension
while there would be multiple formats to serialize a NavMesh to:

  - `.snb` - **S**harp**N**av **B**inary (custom binary format)
  - `.snj` - **S**harp**N**av **J**SON
  - `.snx` - **S**harp**N**av **X**ML
  - Interop with Recast file format (no official extension as far as I know)
  
I will also write up a specification for the binary file format (I might not
if the data is stored in a straightforward manner). I decided to include two
text-based formats since people will have their own preference and supporting
both will be relatively simple, and I'll make sure to write up a schema for
both.

There will be both a command-line tool and a graphical tool (that will also be
able to import/tweak/export a `.sncfg` file.

The work I put into this tonight was setting up the projects and getting
started with the CLI tool by grabbing [Mono.Options][1] and messing around
with command line options. I also set up [YamlDotNet][2], but haven't gotten
around to messing with it yet. Tomorrow I'll start thinking about what the
configuration file should include/look like.

Also I took a peek at my NuGet account and saw this:

![Almost 2k SharpFont downloads!](/img/post/day16/sharpfont-dl.png)

As of this writing, it's at 2,018 downloads. The first 1,000 was exciting, the
second thousand is kinda cool, and if/when I reach 10k downloads, it will be
**very** awesome!
