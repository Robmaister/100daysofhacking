`PolyMeshDetail` is fixed!**\*** Yay!

**\*** When the sampling distance isn't incredibly small, like it is in the
header image.

There were two main changes I made. The first one was to update the distance
algorithm for sample points, which is new in Recast. The generated hull was
still broken, but it seemed to be placing new verts better.

I actually messed up this method at first and it prevented any additional
points from being generated. Since `PolyMeshDetail` now triangulates the mesh
initially and then generates Delaunay hulls with each additional sample point,
the result was a triangulated version of the polygons, which is useless but
technically valid output. It would be the same as setting the maximum distance
between the polygon and the mesh infinity (or a really high value).

The other change I made was flipping two fields in my `EdgeInfo` struct. I had
initially assumed that the struct stored the left face of an edge first and
the right face second. This was due to how Recast deals with sequential data.
No structs are defined, fields are merely offsets into an integer array. For
example:

{% highlight cpp %}
if (e == EV_UNDEF)
{
	int* edge = &edges[nedges*4];
	edge[0] = s;
	edge[1] = t;
	edge[2] = l;
	edge[3] = r;
	return nedges++;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, you have an array of edge structs (with 4 fields), where the edge being
modified is at index `nedges`.

This is where I took my assumed definition of the `EdgeInfo` struct. However,
taking a peek at the source code later in the process:

{% highlight cpp %}
for (int i = 0; i < nedges; ++i)
{
	const int* e = &edges[i*4];
	if (e[3] >= 0)
	{
		// Left face
		int* t = &tris[e[3]*4];
		if (t[0] == -1)
		{
			t[0] = e[0];
			t[1] = e[1];
		}
		else if (t[0] == e[1])
			t[2] = e[0];
		else if (t[1] == e[0])
			t[2] = e[1];
	}
	if (e[2] >= 0)
	{
		// Right
		int* t = &tris[e[2]*4];
		if (t[0] == -1)
		{
			t[0] = e[1];
			t[1] = e[0];
		}
		else if (t[0] == e[0])
			t[2] = e[1];
		else if (t[1] == e[1])
			t[2] = e[0];
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the comments refer to `e[3]` as "Left face" and `e[2]` as "Right".
This contradicts the assumed definition I had earlier on. So I flipped the
location of the left and right fields, and everything started working nearly
perfectly. If you add too much detail then the hull generation starts
breaking, which leads me to believe that the issue is deeper than this simple
change.

![It works!](/img/post/day5/working.png)

PolyMesh and PolyMeshDetail in the future may be heavily modified or
re-written independently of Recast's implementation. I think I did a pretty
good job at converting `ContourSet` to an implementation that works better in
C# than a straight C++ to C# port.

I'd still have to go back and profile my code and compare it to how long
Recast's process takes, since one of the main points of SharpNav is to build
these navigation meshes at runtime, so performance is as important a factor
to it's design as a clean and C#-like API. This is also what sets it apart
from [CritterAI](http://www.critterai.org/).

**This is good enough to ship a version 1.0 of SharpNav.**

Currently on NuGet (the C# package manager), I've only released a beta
version, [0.9.2][1], with this issue being the only blocking one.

The only other thing I have to do (which I wouldn't consider an issue) is
refactoring the public API. Since I want SharpNav to be Real Software&#0153;
I'm going to try and follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][2], so the next
release I'm going to push out will probably be `v1.0.0-alpha.1`.

From there, I will plan biweekly-ish releases incrementing the alpha version
until I'm happy with the public API.

It looks like tomorrow is lining up to be a day of package management and
releases for both SharpNav and SharpFont.
